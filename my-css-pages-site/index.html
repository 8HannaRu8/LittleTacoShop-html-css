      <h4>The Most Beautiful Forests in the World</h4>
      <p>
        Few earthly experiences are as soothing—or as humbling—as standing in
        the middle of a beautiful forest, trees towering around you in every
        direction. Yet throughout the world, from North America's national parks
        to a remote island off of Yemen, you can find these commanding, verdant
        woodlands, some so otherworldly it's hard to believe they're real.
        Whether you're looking for a little trip inspiration or need a virtual
        escape, these shots of 2,000-year-old redwoods, thick green bamboo, and
        pines surrounded by carpets of bluebells ought to take you away. From
        Belgium to California, and Colombia to Spain, these are 13 of the most
        beautiful forests in the world.

        Forest, Basque Country, Spain The Basque Country's Gorbea Natural Park
        is a protected area filled with mountain views, hiking trails,
        waterfalls, and caves. But it's the enigmatic Otzarreta Forest within
        the park that has captured the eye of many a photographer (and Pinterest
        user), with its mossy surfaces and ancient trees.

        Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Kyoto, Japan While we could go on about the
        ethereal glow and seemingly endless heights of this bamboo grove on the
        outskirts of Kyoto, the pleasures here extend beyond the visual realm.
        If you close your eyes, tune out the other tourists, and listen to the
        wind—wood creaking, leaves rustling—you'll experience the true beauty of
        the destination. In 1996, the local Ministry of the Environment even
        included Arashiyama as one of the country's top 100 Soundscapes of
        Japan, an initiative to combat noise pollution and encourage people to
        take in the sounds of the natural world.

        Otzarreta Dragon's Blood Forest, Socotra, Yemen Located about 220 miles
        off the southeast coast of mainland Yemen, the beautiful forest of
        Socotra feels like it was transported to Earth from another planet. And
        perhaps nothing better conveys that sense of otherness than the island's
        population of dragon's blood trees, with their UFO-like tops and eerie
        bright red sap (hence the name).

        <h4>How Do Forests Form?</h4>
        <p>
          Forests are some of the most fascinating environments on the planet,
          filled with amazing natural mysteries to explore and discover. One of
          the best ways to really appreciate these environments more deeply is
          by learning how forests form through a process called “forest
          succession”.
        </p>
        <p>
          All forests go through distinct stages of growth as they develop from
          non-forested lands into full canopies of old growth. This process is
          called forest succession, where hardy pioneer species are gradually
          replaced by more sensitive climax tree species.
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding how forest succession works in your local area,
          you’ll know how to read the patterns of forest formation and gain all
          kinds of fascinating insight about the birds, plants & animals living
          there. So let’s take a closer look at the key stages of forest
          succession and understand how forests form all around the world!
        </p>
        <h4>What Is Forest Succession?</h4>
        <p>
          Forest succession is the core environmental process behind how an area
          of barren land develops gradually more complex and sensitive
          ecologies. This process begins whenever an area having forest
          potential goes through a disturbance pattern that interrupts the life
          cycle of trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern times, common forms of forest disturbances include things
          like logging, forest fires, hurricanes & desertification. Trees are
          the defining feature of a fully formed forest, but trees are also
          quite sensitive species that tend to not grow very well in disturbed
          soil conditions. There needs to be a certain level of pre-existing
          plant life and soil stability in order for trees to become established
          on a large scale.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          ❝ Forests are a perfect example of nature acting like an intelligent
          system, and if you’ve ever stepped foot in an old growth forest, you
          might have noticed these ecosystems feel almost alive. ❞
        </p>
        <p>
          So nature responds by growing a succession of different plant stages
          over a period of years that gradually improves moisture retention,
          soil ph & surface organic matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amazing thing is once you know how to observe forest succession,
          it’s one of the most effective ways to gain predictive insight about
          the plants, trees, birds, animals & history of any landscape. Signs of
          forest succession are everywhere in nature, so this is really one of
          the easiest ways to study the natural world and make discoveries
          through direct observation. I got into studying forest succession
          because of my interest in wildlife tracking, but I ended up falling in
          love with forests in general because they truly are so amazing.
          Forests are a perfect example of nature acting like an intelligent
          system, and if you’ve ever stepped foot in an old growth forest, you
          might have noticed these ecosystems feel almost alive.
